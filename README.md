#Introduction
This app by a team of four people over six days and was the third of four projects during our time on the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly, London.
The requirements of this project were to build an authenticated RESTful MEAN stack application.

#The App
**Vibes** is an online application which allows users to benefit from each others' expertise and altruistic disposition. It is essentially a skills exchange forum. Each user is able to ask the community for help with a specific task and each user is able to choose whether or not they want to offer help with any specific task.    
It is a site which runs on good vibes alone. No money, no profit.

#How to use the site
Upon registering each user is able to list one skill they would like to learn or service which they would appreciate some assistance with (such as learning the guitar or moving house).
They can then browse deeds which other users have added and choose whether or not to help with with any given request. If they do choose to help the user is then able to contact this person through the site's messaging system.
Each user has a record of the messages which they have sent to other users and of messages which have been sent to them.


#How it was built
**Vibes** is a MEAN stack application. It was made using Bootstrap CSS framework, SASS, and ES6.
We made use of Bower to manage front end packages, NPM to manage back end packages, Babel to minify and transpile SCSS and ES6 and Gulp as our task runner.

#Challenges during the build
Although we learnt many new technical skills during this project, this was the first team project any of us had done. As a result this required a different approach to organisation and a greater dependency and more in-depth use of GitHub.
We used a Trello board to delegate daily tasks either to individuals or pairs and held stand ups either twice or three times daily in order to log progress with other team members.
The use of Git/GitHub for team work flow is what proved to be the greatest technical challenge. Throughout the process we all became proficient and disciplined in working on individual branches, merging our work to a development branch and resolving conflicts.

#Getting started
These steps are required in order to run the application:
-  Gulp and Node must be installed
- Populate the database by running the following command in the root directory of the application using the terminal: 'node db/seeds.js'
- Install all the relevant NPM packages and Bower running the commands 'npm i' and 'bower i' in the root directory of the application using the terminal
- Go to 'http://localhost:3000' in your browser to view the site.
